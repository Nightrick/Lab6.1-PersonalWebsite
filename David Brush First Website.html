        <p>Hello there! My name is David Brush, and this is my Java portfolio website. Here, you can learn a little bit more about me and the work I've been doing in the Java programming language!</p>
        <div>
            <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
            <p>The purpose of this website it to showcase my body of work in the Java programming language, as well as offer a quick overview of who I am, why I'm doing what I'm doing, and what's next.</p>

            <h4>Coding Proficiencies</h4>
            <p>Thus far, I've acquired proficiency in the following technologies and concepts:
                <ul>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>Git/GitHub</li>
                    <li>HTML (sort of, as you can see)</li>
                    <li>CSS (see above comment)</li>
                    <li>MySQL</li>
                    <li>MongoDB</li>
                    <li>Spring</li>
                </ul>
                For examples of my work, please see the Java Portfolio section below!

            <h4>Why Tech?</h4>
            <p>
                "David," I hear you saying, "Aren't you a successful chemist? Why learn Java now at the age of 30?" 
                Well, my friend with the keen observations, it's because coding offers me the same chance to critically think, without the oppressive environment of the auto industry or the chemically dangerous environment of a lab. Good enough reason, I think! Plus I love coding, so that goes a long way! Maybe one day, I'll prove it by making this website into something pleasant to look at. For now, function over form.

            <P>Hopefully this counts as a footer! I like it better than the header!</P>
