    <h4>Biography</h4>
    <p> I'm currently training to become a Java developer at Detroit Grand Circus. The projects I've worked on include basic video games, library applications, and more, which can be viewed in my GitHub portfolio below. I have a bachelor's degree in biochemistry from the University of Detroit Mercy, and I've published academic research in Macromolecules on the topic of ESR spin probing of hydrocarbon ionomers. I'm transitioning into tech because I've found that it offers an immensely satisfying opportunity to think critically and work on projects I'm passionate about, without the health risks that are inherent in a laboratory setting. 

        My experience in the chemical industry has been focused on automotive adhesives and sealers, for which I've done both quality and development. In my current role as a senior development chemist at EFTEC North America, I lead a small team of chemists and interns to create new formulas based on customer specifications, as well as maintain existing products and assist production and quality control departments as needed.</p>
